# Arduino-Lab-Code
My attempts at completing the various coding exercises provided as activities to complete in an optional Arduino lab.

## In these sessions, we covered:
- Lab 1: Creating our first assembly program, clearing SREG to set up the execution of code created in subsequent labs.
- Lab 2: Experimenting with the I/O interface, assembling the Arduino to produce a program which turns on a constant light.
- Lab 3: Arithmetic and branching, addition/subtraction/comparisons in Assembly.
- Lab 4: (Found this to be the hardest) Coding delays into the Arduino, creating psuedo-timing based on clock cycles.
- Lab 5: Bit operations: Bit shifting, Masking and Composition with bit-wise AND/OR.
